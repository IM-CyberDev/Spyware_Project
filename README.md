# Spyware_Project

Simple webcam spyware with python 3 and OpenCV. First made in december 2018.

You can put target.py and server.py at two seperate folders and test locally.

target.py is meant to be delivered to the target/victim's PC and server.py is the script of the server(receives videos from the victim's PC)
